  title: KEDA operator crash
  category: crash
  author: Prequel
  description: |
    KEDA allows for fine-grained autoscaling (including to/from zero) for event driven Kubernetes workloads. KEDA serves as a Kubernetes Metrics Server and allows users to define autoscaling rules using a dedicated Kubernetes custom resource definition.
  cause: |
    There is a known issue with the KEDA operator where the scalers cache from the ScaledObject controller is not being properly initialized. This can cause the KEDA operator to crash.
