# Common Relability Enumeration (CRE) Specification

## What are Common Reliability Enumerations (CREs)?

Until now, there's been no consistent way to describe reliability problems, impact and mitigations in modern software systems. Teams often reinvent the wheel, diagnose incidents in isolation, and lack a shared vocabulary to talk about recurring problems.

Standards like CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) changed the game in security. They provide a method to classify and share known threats. CREs provide an equivalent standard for reliability problems.

***Common Reliability Enumerations (CREs)*** are an open, structured standard for naming and categorizing reliability problems found in production systems. CREs represent a community of hundreds of engineers and practitioners across startups, enterprises, and critical infrastructure providers on how best to detect reliability problems.

The CRE standard makes problem detection repeatable. It helps teams move from reactive fire-fighting to proactive prevention while leveraging the knowledge of the problem detection community.

With CREs, you can:

* Recognize known failure modes before they escalate
* Correlate similar issues across services, teams, or companies
* Drive better postmortems, triage, and tooling decisions
* Contribute your own findings to an evolving, community-backed index

CREs give teams a common framework to identify, compare, and learn from reliability issuesâ€”making patterns visible that were previously siloed or overlooked.

When paired with rules, CREs become a powerful way to both understand and detect problems.
